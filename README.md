### Step 3: Claim Your Spot on the Pitch

The World Cup starts with your profile. Fork this repo, create your player card in the `/profile` directory, and step onto the field.


#### 1. Fork the Repository
Fork [this repository](https://github.com/gtech-mulearn/mufifa-2026) to your own GitHub profile.

#### 2. Create Your Profile File
Create a new Markdown file inside the `/profile` folder, named using your MUID - your squad number for the tournament:

```
profile/yourname@mulearn.md
```

#### 3. Fill Out Your Profile
Use the provided template to build your player profile: [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md)

#### 4. Open a Pull Request
Once ready, open a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch. Your card is now on the pitch!

> **Pro Tip:** Study [example@mulearn.md](./profile/sachinrajm@mulearn.md) to see what a great μFIFA profile looks like.

### Step 4: Link Your μLearn Profile Card

Your profile card is what shows your live karma rank and squad domain progress on the μLearn leaderboard. Don't skip this step!

#### 1. Get Your Embed Link
Head to the [μLearn Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/771670169691881483/1157030408874106991), use the `/get-embed-link` command, and copy the link.

#### 2. Update Your Profile Card Embed
Paste the embed link into the **Profile Card** section at the bottom of your profile file.

#### 3. Open a Pull Request

## Profile Validation

Every profile is automatically checked - both on your machine before you commit, and on GitHub when you open a PR. You'll get clear error messages telling you exactly what to fix.

**What gets checked:**
- Filename follows the `yourname@mulearn.md` format
- Header includes Squad Domain(s) and FIFA Nation
- About Me is at least 200 characters
- All required sections are present
- Sections aren't left with placeholder text
- Profile Card embed is filled with your actual MUID
- MUID in filename matches the Profile Card

### Set up the pre-commit hook (one time, after cloning)

```sh
sh scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

After this, every time you `git commit` a profile file, the validator runs automatically. If anything's wrong, the commit is blocked with a clear message - before it ever reaches GitHub.

### Run the validator manually

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_profile.py profile/yourname@mulearn.md
```

The same check runs automatically on every PR via GitHub Actions - so even if someone skips the local hook, nothing broken gets merged.
